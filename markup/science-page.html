                                    RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene
                                    expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically,
                                    RNAi
                                    was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene
                                    silencing
                                    (PTGS), and quelling. The detailed study of each of these seemingly different
                                    processes
                                    elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually RNAi. Since the
                                    discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has
                                    immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi is now known as precise,
                                    efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene correction. However,
                                    antisense RNA produced intracellularly by an expression vector may be developed and
                                    find
                                    utility as novel therapeutic agents.

                                    Two types of small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules – microRNA (miRNA) and small
                                    interfering RNA (siRNA) – are central to RNA interference. RNAs are the direct
                                    products
                                    of genes, and these small RNAs can direct enzyme complexes to degrade messenger RNA
                                    (mRNA) molecules and thus decrease their activity by preventing translation, via
                                    post-transcriptional gene silencing. Moreover, transcription can be inhibited via
                                    the
                                    pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of RNA interference, through which an enzyme
                                    complex catalyzes DNA methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed
                                    siRNA
                                    or miRNA. RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against
                                    parasitic
                                    nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons. It also influences development.

                                    The RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes, including animals, and is initiated by
                                    the
                                    enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short
                                    double-stranded fragments of ~21 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two
                                    single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The
                                    passenger
                                    strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced
                                    silencing
                                    complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene
                                    silencing,
                                    which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a
                                    messenger
                                    RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of
                                    the
                                    RISC. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially
                                    limited molar concentrations of siRNA.
                                </p>

                                    RNAi is a valuable research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms,
                                    because
                                    synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce
                                    suppression or
                                    correction of specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens
                                    that
                                    systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the
                                    components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell
                                    division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology, medicine
                                    and
                                    insecticides.

                                    RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene silencing process that is controlled by the
                                    RNA-induced
                                    silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in
                                    a
                                    cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute.
                                    When
                                    the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or
                                    laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and
                                    cleaved
                                    to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous
                                    (originating in
                                    the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The
                                    primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic
                                    stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm.
                                    Thus,
                                    the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.
                                </p>

                                    Exogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by activating the ribonuclease protein Dicer, which
                                    binds
                                    and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plants, or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
                                    in
                                    humans, to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 base pairs with a 2-nucleotide
                                    overhang at the 3' end. Bioinformatics studies on the genomes of multiple organisms
                                    suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific
                                    effects. These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs
                                    (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an
                                    active RISC, by RISC-Loading Complex (RLC). RLC includes Dicer-2 and R2D2, and is
                                    crucial to unite Ago2 and RISC. TATA-binding protein-associated factor 11 (TAF11)
                                    assembles the RLC by facilitating Dcr-2-R2D2 tetramerization, which increases the
                                    binding affinity to siRNA by 10-fold. Association with TAF11 would convert the
                                    R2-D2-Initiator (RDI) complex into the RLC. R2D2 carries tandem double-stranded
                                    RNA-binding domains to recognize the thermodynamically stable terminus of siRNA
                                    duplexes, whereas Dicer-2 the other less stable extremity. Loading is asymmetric:
                                    the
                                    MID domain of Ago2 recognizes the thermodynamically stable end of the siRNA.
                                    Therefore,
                                    the "passenger" (sense) strand whose 50 end is discarded by MID is ejected, while
                                    the
                                    saved "guide" (antisense) strand cooperates with AGO to form the RISC.

                                    RNA interference is a vital part of the immune response to viruses and other foreign
                                    genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the
                                    self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express
                                    multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is
                                    exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it
                                    was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant in
                                    a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting.
                                    This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune
                                    system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized
                                    encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to
                                    suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short
                                    double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those
                                    produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to
                                    infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized
                                    response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids
                                    the infection process.

                                    Although animals generally express fewer variants of the dicer enzyme than plants,
                                    RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult
                                    Drosophila, RNA interference is important in antiviral innate immunity and is active
                                    against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate
                                    in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and
                                    worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral
                                    infection.

                                    The role of RNA interference in mammalian innate immunity is poorly understood, and
                                    relatively little data is available. However, the existence of viruses that encode
                                    genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in
                                    favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has
                                    been challenged as poorly substantiated. Evidence for the existence of a functional
                                    antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells has been presented.
